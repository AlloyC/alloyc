  // This didn't work
  // TODOs alot of reading no watching movie tomorrow no matter how bored I get
  // I did research on arduino and also learnt about FETs
  // All night reading made my day useless
  // Sunday I learnt more on mosfet enhancement mode and studied for test
  // wrote a bad test read abit with Divine
  // I don't kniw why i don't feel like reading today even though  I know the consequences of not reading. I will try to read alit before I sleep.
  // I need a risk-reward system
  // I created a routine that I plan to follow starting tomorrow
  // I followed my routine to a great extent today. although I swapped some hours routine but all in all. I made progress.
  // What worked out was most of my morning routines. I had trouble assimilating in the morning though but later in the afternoon I started to assimilate better. I don't know for sure if my body had not fully woken up or I just not a early morning reader. I would try it out again tomorrow to see if I will assimilate better than I did today.
  // My breakfast was dependent on Raphaels room which was on in alignment with my schedule so I ended up taking something else for breakfast. I think I will stick to taking just bread and tea for breakfast so I don't have to depend on them.
  // Once I go downstairs I usually down't want to comeback to being focused so I should have a timer when I go downstairs to trigger me back upstair.
  // Hi future me, so today is day 2 of implementing the new routine. here is what I learnt, first that I am human and not a robot. I woke up turn off my alarm and slept back for an extra 48 mins before starting my day. this inturn led to a shift in my schedule timing. Trying to make up fot the lost time led to shifting in the order of my schedule. About reading in the mmorning. It was totally the course as I was able to read and understand today although i started reading around 7:40+am, so I cant say It is totally the course since I started with the course too. So maybe my body had not fully woken up then.
  // I limited the time I spent downstair and my productivity skyrocketed. As The mountain is you said, to change you will probabily loss relationship.
  // My lesson today is based on focus. I was more focused today when I had my day planned out. with limited time with friends and social media.
  // Today I achieved nothing my day was stolen by my mood and I fear staying in my room. I think I am starting to associate my room with seriousness.
  // I don't know how to get out of unseriousness. I don't know why I feel the way I feel sometimes
  // I got nothing today
  // I learnt abit about microcontollers and also researchd on career path for eee. I'm still not super clear how to go about it but I think I am a bit clearer than the last time so. I will still conntinue my research until I am clear it is the right path for me.
  // I have resolved into folowing my path into electrinics and not waste any energy learning web development. Also I am planning on locating an e-waste location to get elcetronics whose working part can be desoldered and saved for future prototyping or learning.
  // I will definitely resume my routine tomorrow
  // Today, I followed my routine as a guide not a strict time rule. But I read more on the personal side than on the school side after I got exhaused to learning. All in all today was a success. What I have to change in my time table is the free time to allow for interactivity with my friend as they are priority to me also.
  // Unproductive day. why? I don't know, the longer I stay downstairs the more unproductive I am.
  // Productive day. measuement? I advoided procastinating to a large extent. I read to a reasonable extent both personal spiritual and academical. Things that helped me is inaccess to data and also staying in my room also. Also the reduced amount of steps before a reading session helped me focus my energy reading than actually setting up and mde it easier to want to read.
  // I don't know what to say. Honestly, I don't know
  // Happy easter !!!
  // Another unproductive day
  // Another unproductive day
  // Broke the cycle. Today I read almost all day. As much as I claim to be just want to fall off the grid I still love people still love to interact with people and I don't know how to interact with people. Las las we go dey alright
  // Another win for me today. I woke up early, read and worked out. I also didn't spend money today one is because I don't really have but the other is because I am trying to caution my spending habit and recover from my last detrimental spending habit. I didn't come online much too today which one fact that is responsible for my productivity today. The only part I haven't really gotten contol over is knowing how to tell my body to stand up and go to my room to be productive. Anyways one step, one punch, one round at a time
  // I won't call today a win. I read and I woke up early but today wasn't it at all. I was down and I had no one to talk to about it. It was quite said if I am being honest to myself. A part of me want to build relationship with people so I don't feel this way again but another part of me feels my personality or should I say my identity is to be alone, All by my self. I didnt spend time downstairs but I still couldn't do what I was suppose to do. where did I mess up? what triggered me into this somewhat bad day. Is it all true what they say and what I keep telling myself about cutting people off? Am I living a fake life. The truth is I am struggling to keep it all together, to keep it all inside because I feel so alone. This is the only reason I crave a relationship . I'll be sha eventually. Good night. sigh!
  // Hey future me or younger me. Today was to an extent a success. I didn't meet my target of finishing the revision of the course I planned to finish. But what I did was learn. I learnt not just the book but prersonally. Now I realise the more I revise or revisit my learning the more I realise I don't know it yet. Today I realise that learning is not something you do in one sitting just seatinging and consuming knowledge but a continuios act of revisit and space repition. As stressful as it sound it is quite easy when broken down to tiny bit. One page, 5 minutes 10 minutes, few lines, one topic but do it alot over the day and this tiny act repeated over a long preiod compond into something significant. I wish I can stay consistent in doing this. Oh and I woke up around 5 about an a hour later than the time my body have been waking up this period and this is because I slept later.
  // Day 117, I lost if today feeling jealosy, rage, frustrated, useless and happy. Up to this moment I feel like I am emotionally attached to my ex which for me isn't right or I don't know. I shouldn't be focusing on her or emotions when I have exams coming up I shouldn't be feeling this way at all. but I guess I am. I was close to telling her I love her maybe because I am scared to lose her. I am scared all this feeling will make me do this I woukd regret I wish I could go for a walk now but it is too late for that. I know tommorow will be better most definitely. Alright good night
  // I spent the whole day fixing my study. I didn't read my bible but I ended talking out my feelings keeping up with the ew friends I have. took my nap now I wanted to sleep but someones generator is pumping smoke into my room.
  // No words to say.....
  // I read productively today. breaking my reading into small chuncks and ignoring the volume of knowlege left unconcumed. Eventually I finished it and I am glad...
  // I want to watch movie as a reward for my determination before I sleep
  // I read abit I think 2 hrs but I have decided to stop the jotting so I can cover more faster.
  // I read abit I maybe less than 2 hrs but I finished the pdf I started so that count or something.
  // Today hmmm. Lets see I was almost close to not reading I watched movie and slept. I want to read now till I feel slepy but tomorrow we go harder hopefully...
