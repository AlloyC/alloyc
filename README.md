I spent four hours watching a movie called Tetris. I started watchng it because I wanted to see a pattarn in how successful enterprise become successful. A pattarn that does not have to be a bad way. Some step generally accepted that I can emulate without feeling like I am doing something wrong. I compared it with the stories of other famous enterprise. Apple -  steve job, facebook - mark zuckerberg, general electric or light bulb - thomas edison, McDonald - Ray Kroc, Alternative current - George westinghouse. You get the gist. What I discover was that although this are not only successful business and great ideas. Most of them credit there success not to the originator of the idea but to other people whose believed strongly in the idea that they were about to go all length to see it go global. They not only believe in it but so a world wide vision a big vision that the pioneer, founder or inventor of the idea. Let's not forget our great example the One who is famous for the past 2000+ years if not more and will still remain famous foever JESUS. He believed so strongly that He did everthing that needed to be irrespective of the pain and sorrow and shame it costed Him. And now He is seated in the right Hand of God and known world wide. 
    So here are my conclusions:
    1. Believe - This is very important even more important than the idea itself. Many people can have idea but without believe then it is just like any other common idea then don't see the light of day.
    2. Work hard - Again more important than the idea. You have to put in an equivalent amount of work to support the work. Even the bible said Faith without work is dead. You have work like your life depends on it. Go the extra length.
    3. Risk - what if it does not work? what if you put in the work and it does not work? Well, what if it does? Start asking the right question. If you believe and you work hard, guess what it will. Our manual, the bible, said seeth thou a man diligent in his work he sha stand before kings not king kings not mean men. How much is too much? There is not limit, no too much. And if it fails, well alteast you've discover something that no one can take away from you, Experience. You seen why it didn't work and now you can go back to the drawing board and re iterate. Look at thomas Edison, 999 fails 1 success. A great qoute once said "Your If you want to develop a good product, you must be prepared to throw away your first version". You are your product
Okay that's it, thats I have to say. Just remember Steve wozniak invented apple computer but Steve jobs is famous for it, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss had facebook original idea but mark is famous for it, Dick and Mac McDonald started McDonald but Ray Kroc is famous for it. Now I know what you're thinking, You left out Thomas Edision and Nikolas tesla. Thomas believed in his idea, worked on it, it is esterblished already with is 1000 trials and took it public by himself. Tesla on the other hand died broke, indebt and lonely in an hotel. And the credit to his work on AC went mostly to George westinghouse and and Thomas edison.
Extra credit the inventor of Tetris, Alexey Pajinov a russian software engineer Henk Rogers and Nintendo were famous for it. Be wise!
